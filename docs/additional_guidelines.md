### Updated Outline of Test Coverage

Incorporating the updated exam details (100 total questions: 55 language, 45 math; 2-hour duration; no points deducted for wrong answers, encouraging strategic guessing), this outline refines the prior structure for a STEM magnet school entrance exam. It maintains focus on critical thinking and foundational skills but adjusts to the specified breakdown, treating "language" as encompassing verbal/ELA and logical reasoning (common in such exams where non-math is grouped as "language arts" or "verbal"). Science and writing are omitted here as not mentioned, assuming this is a variant or core focus test. Coverage emphasizes STEM aptitude through math-heavy problem-solving and language-based analysis.

1. **Mathematics**: Assesses quantitative reasoning, algebraic manipulation, geometric concepts, and data interpretation. No calculator; focuses on efficiency and application to real-world STEM scenarios.

2. **Language**: Covers verbal proficiency (reading comprehension, vocabulary, grammar) and logical reasoning (patterns, deductions, analogies). Tests analytical reading and thinking skills essential for STEM literacy (e.g., interpreting technical texts).

Overall: 100 questions, multiple-choice dominant for quick grading. Timed at 120 minutes total (e.g., 60-70 minutes math, 50-60 minutes language). No penalties for incorrect answers promote completion. Variations can integrate subtle STEM themes (e.g., math word problems on physics).

### Guidelines for Creating Tests (Refined)

These updated guidelines align with the new specs while preserving realism and engagement. Use for generating variations (e.g., 5 tests with remixed questions).

#### 1. **Overall Structure**
   - **Length and Timing**: Exactly 100 questions (45 math, 55 language). Total time: 120 minutes (allocate ~65 minutes to language, ~55 to math for balance). Include a timer in the app; no breaks enforced.
   - **Section Breakdown**: Two main sections—Language (55 questions), Math (45 questions). Subdivide for pacing (e.g., language into verbal and logical subparts).
   - **Pagination/Format**: 10-15 questions per "page" (total ~8-10 pages). 80-90% multiple-choice; mix in true/false, matching, or open-ended for variety (limited to auto-gradable).
   - **Difficulty Levels**: 30% easy, 40% medium, 30% hard. Tag in JSON. Variations: Shift difficulty (e.g., more hard math for advanced tests).
   - **Scoring**: 1 point per question (max 100). No deductions—total correct answers = score. App provides percentage and feedback. For variations: Set benchmarks (e.g., 85%+ for "magnet-ready").

#### 2. **Content Inclusion per Area**
   - **Mathematics** (45 questions):
     - Include: Arithmetic (10-15 questions: operations, fractions), algebra (10-15: equations, functions), geometry/data (15-20: shapes, graphs, probability). Tie to STEM (e.g., engineering calculations).
     - Guidelines: Emphasize multi-step problems. Variations: Theme subsets (e.g., geometry-focused variant).

   - **Language** (55 questions):
     - Include: Verbal/ELA (30-35 questions: comprehension passages, vocabulary, grammar) and logical reasoning (20-25: sequences, puzzles, analogies). Use STEM-related texts (e.g., science articles for reading).
     - Guidelines: Balance sub-areas; keep passages short (200-300 words). Variations: Increase logic for analytical emphasis.

#### 3. **Question Design and Variety**
   - **Types**: Stick to 5 (multiple choice dominant; others for engagement). Ensure app renders dynamically from JSON.
   - **Quality Standards**: Clear, age-appropriate (8th-grade level); explanations for all. Encourage guessing via no penalties—design distractors to teach common pitfalls.
   - **Inclusivity/Engagement**: Diverse contexts (e.g., STEM innovators). Add diagrams for 10% (e.g., logic puzzles).
   - **Sourcing**: Adapt from samples; use AI for generation.

#### 4. **General Best Practices**
   - **Balance and Progression**: Language first (builds confidence), math second. Variations: Remix questions or add time pressure.
   - **Testing/Validation**: Simulate in app; ensure no deductions in scoring logic.
   - **JSON Export**: One file per test; include timeLimit: 7200 (seconds).
   - **Variations Strategy**: Base on this outline; alter 20% questions per variant for practice.
