# Designing Tests Workspace

This folder holds in-progress exam designs. Each exam is developed in its own subfolder and compiled to a single JSON file for use in the app.

## Exam Structure
- Two sections per exam:
  - `Language Arts & Writing` — 55 questions built around a shared passage, vocabulary derived from that passage, targeted grammar/sentence revision items, and 20–25 logical reasoning prompts (analogies, sequences, deductions).
  - `Mathematics` — 45 questions emphasizing middle-school algebra topics (linear equations, inequalities, proportional reasoning, coordinate plane analysis) plus arithmetic fundamentals and geometry/data interpretation.
- Time limit: 2 hours (120 minutes). Aim for ~65 minutes of content pacing in Language Arts & Writing and ~55 minutes in Mathematics.
- Scoring: 1 point per question; no deductions for incorrect or blank answers. Maintain a 30% easy / 40% medium / 30% hard mix across the whole exam.

## Pagination & Shards
- Structure shards around 8–12 questions each to support page-sized delivery (roughly 8 pages for Language Arts & Writing, 5 pages for Mathematics) while keeping passages and multi-part problems intact.
- Balance shard totals so compiled exams maintain the 55/45 question split.
- Include clear `instructions` on grammar prompts and reference passage-driven vocabulary explicitly in each question.
- Attach metadata needed by the renderer within each shard:
  - Passage data objects (`title`, `author`, `source`, full `body`) before the related questions.
  - Skill tagging: `reading-comprehension`, `vocabulary`, `grammar`, `logical-reasoning` for Language Arts; algebra-focused tags (e.g., `linear-equations`, `inequalities`, `proportions`, `word-problems`, `data-interpretation`) for Mathematics.
- Track question difficulty directly in shards so the compiled exam hits the 30/40/30 distribution. Adjust follow-up shards if one section skews too easy or too hard.
- Incorporate diagrams, tables, or charts for roughly 10% of questions overall; provide concise alt text.

## Folder Convention
- `designing_tests/exam-YYYYMMDD/` — one subfolder per exam in development.
  - Suggested contents:
    - `manifest.json` — minimal metadata + list of section shard files.
    - `sections/` — per-section shards (arrays of question objects), e.g. `math.page-1.json`.
    - `compiled.exam.json` — compiled exam JSON output (generated by the tool).

## Workflow
1. Draft questions by section and type, tagging with `difficulty` and `tags`.
2. List each shard in `manifest.json` under the appropriate section in the desired order.
3. Compile to a single exam JSON with `node tools/compile_exam.mjs <exam-folder>`.
4. Validate the output (schema in `schema/`) and load in the app.

## Example
- Sharded design: `designing_tests/exam-sample/` (has `manifest.json` and `sections/` shards).
- Compiled example: `designing_tests/example.exam.json` for reference.
