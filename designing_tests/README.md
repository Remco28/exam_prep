# Designing Tests Workspace

This folder holds in-progress exam designs. Each exam is developed in its own subfolder and compiled to a single JSON file for use in the app.

## Folder Convention
- `designing_tests/exam-YYYYMMDD/` — one subfolder per exam in development.
  - Suggested contents:
    - `manifest.json` — minimal metadata + list of section shard files.
    - `sections/` — per-section shards (arrays of question objects), e.g. `math.page-1.json`.
    - `compiled.exam.json` — compiled exam JSON output (generated by the tool).

## Workflow
1. Draft questions by section and type, tagging with `difficulty` and `tags`.
2. List each shard in `manifest.json` under the appropriate section in the desired order.
3. Compile to a single exam JSON with `node tools/compile_exam.mjs <exam-folder>`.
4. Validate the output (schema in `schema/`) and load in the app.

## Example
- Sharded design: `designing_tests/exam-sample/` (has `manifest.json` and `sections/` shards).
- Compiled example: `designing_tests/example.exam.json` for reference.
