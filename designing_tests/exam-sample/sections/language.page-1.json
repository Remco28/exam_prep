    "text": "Read the passage below and answer the questions that follow.\n\nPASSAGE:\nIn 1895, engineer Emily Warren Roebling stood before a crowd to describe how the Brooklyn Bridge balanced innovation with safety. She detailed how thousands of steel wires were woven into flexible cables, allowing the bridge to sway without snapping. Roebling emphasized that every calculation considered wind, weight, and time, reminding listeners that engineering is the art of meeting human needs with scientific care.\n\nWhat primary idea does Roebling highlight in the passage?",
    "options": [
      "Engineers should prioritize artistic design over safety.",
      "Engineering combines creativity with rigorous planning to serve people.",
      "The Brooklyn Bridge relied on experimental materials that ultimately failed.",
